# MetaPayP2P on Metis Andromeda — Web3 Basic Income Simulation with AI & Peer Transfers

*(Powered by OpenAI API & Alith AI)*


---

## 🌍 Project Overview

MetaPayP2P is a Web3-based simulation of a circulating basic income system designed by Gyuha Yoon.  
Its purpose is to demonstrate a sustainable economic model where income is continuously circulated rather than endlessly printed.

- ✅ National Wallet distributes funds equally to 10 citizen wallets over 10 distribution rounds.  
- ✅ After every 10 distributions, 10% of citizen balances are recollected.  
- ✅ This Distribute → Recollect → Repeat cycle ensures sustainability.  
- ✅ Citizens are free to engage in peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers anytime, simulating a real economic ecosystem.  
- ✅ Alith AI monitors economic activity and warns of imbalances or risks.  
- ✅ OpenAI API powers AI-generated behavior logic and intelligent alerts.

## 💡 Why MetaPay Matters

- 🔄 Demonstrates a tax-free, sustainable circulating basic income model.
- 🏛️ Offers a scalable concept for real-world pilot programs.
- 🤖 Integrates AI-driven behavior analysis for responsible financial interaction.
- 💬 Promotes transparent peer-to-peer economic activities on blockchain.

## 💹 MetaPay Circulation Model Overview

The chart below illustrates the MetaPay Basic Income Circulation Model:

![MetaPay Circulation Chart](./public/metapay_full_flow_chart.png)

- 🟩 Monthly distribution (green)  
- 🟥 Recollection every 10 rounds (red)  
- 🔵 Cumulative circulating balance (blue line)  

> This graph demonstrates how the balance grows with 10 cycles of distribution and stabilizes through periodic recollection, enabling a sustainable circulation model of basic income.

**Important:**  
In the MetaPay simulation, the national wallet must follow a strict cycle of **10 rounds of distribution followed by 1 round of recollection**, repeated continuously.  

If after 10 distributions and 1 recollection the **National Wallet balance remains at 4999**, the system requires **manual adjustment** by transferring **1 unit** from a **user wallet holding an odd amount of MetaPay** back to the National Wallet.  

This allows the next distribution to proceed normally.

> In real-life pilot projects, population increase or decrease may require manual adjustment accounts or automated balancing bots to stabilize the circulation system.

---

## 🏛️ Real-World Pilot Project Consideration

MetaPay’s model suggests implementing either:

- ✅ **Manual Adjustment Accounts** for population fluctuations  
- ✅ **Automated Balancing Bots** integrated with on-chain monitoring tools  

This allows seamless adaptation even in dynamic economic environments.

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- ✅ Phase 1: Simulation & AI Behavior Analysis (Completed)
- 🔄 Phase 2: Automated Balancing Mechanism (Planned)
- 🏛️ Phase 3: Institutional Pilot Testing with Governments/NGOs (Planned)

## 🧠 Alith AI (Alice AI) — Behavior Analysis & Risk Warning

Alith AI acts as a behavior analysis engine that continuously monitors user transactions, P2P transfers, and corporate fund flows to detect potential risks or abnormal activities.  

It complements the OpenAI API by delivering context-aware warnings and balancing suggestions within the basic income simulation.

- 🧩 Analyzes transaction behaviors and P2P transfers  
- ⚖️ Monitors inflow vs. outflow for each corporate account  
- 📢 Generates risk warnings based on behavior patterns  
- 💬 Integrates with OpenAI API for natural language explanations  

---

## 🤖 AI-Driven Behavior Logic

With the power of OpenAI API, MetaPayP2P simulates intelligent interactions such as:

- 📊 Proportional transfers (e.g., salary)  
- 📉 Risk-based warnings for over-expenditure or liquidity issues  
- 📝 AI-generated suggestions for economic balancing

## ℹ️ Note on Cash Handling

The **cash transfer simulation** (💵) is handled entirely on the **frontend** for demonstration purposes only.  
This allows flexible scenario creation for demo videos and user testing.  
All **MetaPay (🪙)** transactions — including distributions and recollections — are processed via **on-chain smart contracts**.

> 📝 The frontend cash logic does not affect blockchain behavior or smart contract operations.
