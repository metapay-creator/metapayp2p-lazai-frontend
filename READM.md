## üåç Project Overview

MetaPayP2P is a Web3-based simulation of a circulating basic income system designed by Gyuha Yoon.  
Its purpose is to demonstrate a sustainable economic model where income is continuously circulated rather than endlessly printed.

- ‚úÖ National Wallet distributes funds equally to 10 citizen wallets over 10 distribution rounds.  
- ‚úÖ After every 10 distributions, 10% of citizen balances are recollected.  
- ‚úÖ This Distribute ‚Üí Recollect ‚Üí Repeat cycle ensures sustainability.  
- ‚úÖ Citizens are free to engage in peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers anytime, simulating a real economic ecosystem.  
- ‚úÖ Alith AI monitors economic activity and warns of imbalances or risks.  
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API powers AI-generated behavior logic and intelligent alerts.

## üí° Why MetaPay Matters

- üîÑ Demonstrates a tax-free, sustainable circulating basic income model.
- üèõÔ∏è Offers a scalable concept for real-world pilot programs.
- ü§ñ Integrates AI-driven behavior analysis for responsible financial interaction.
- üí¨ Promotes transparent peer-to-peer economic activities on blockchain.

## üíπ MetaPay Circulation Model Overview

The chart below illustrates the MetaPay Basic Income Circulation Model:

![MetaPay Circulation Chart](./public/metapay_full_flow_chart.png)

- üü© Monthly distribution (green)  
- üü• Recollection every 10 rounds (red)  
- üîµ Cumulative circulating balance (blue line)  

> This graph demonstrates how the balance grows with 10 cycles of distribution and stabilizes through periodic recollection, enabling a sustainable circulation model of basic income.

**Important:**  
In the MetaPay simulation, the national wallet must follow a strict cycle of **10 rounds of distribution followed by 1 round of recollection**, repeated continuously.  

If after 10 distributions and 1 recollection the **National Wallet balance remains at 4999**, the system requires **manual adjustment** by transferring **1 unit** from a **user wallet holding an odd amount of MetaPay** back to the National Wallet.  

This allows the next distribution to proceed normally.

> In real-life pilot projects, population increase or decrease may require manual adjustment accounts or automated balancing bots to stabilize the circulation system.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Real-World Pilot Project Consideration

MetaPay‚Äôs model suggests implementing either:

- ‚úÖ **Manual Adjustment Accounts** for population fluctuations  
- ‚úÖ **Automated Balancing Bots** integrated with on-chain monitoring tools  

This allows seamless adaptation even in dynamic economic environments.

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Simulation & AI Behavior Analysis (Completed)
- üîÑ Phase 2: Automated Balancing Mechanism (Planned)
- üèõÔ∏è Phase 3: Institutional Pilot Testing with Governments/NGOs (Planned)

## üß† Alith AI (Alice AI) ‚Äî Behavior Analysis & Risk Warning

Alith AI acts as a behavior analysis engine that continuously monitors user transactions, P2P transfers, and corporate fund flows to detect potential risks or abnormal activities.  

It complements the OpenAI API by delivering context-aware warnings and balancing suggestions within the basic income simulation.

- üß© Analyzes transaction behaviors and P2P transfers  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Monitors inflow vs. outflow for each corporate account  
- üì¢ Generates risk warnings based on behavior patterns  
- üí¨ Integrates with OpenAI API for natural language explanations  

---

## ü§ñ AI-Driven Behavior Logic

With the power of OpenAI API, MetaPayP2P simulates intelligent interactions such as:

- üìä Proportional transfers (e.g., salary)  
- üìâ Risk-based warnings for over-expenditure or liquidity issues  
- üìù AI-generated suggestions for economic balancing

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note on Cash Handling

The **cash transfer simulation** (üíµ) is handled entirely on the **frontend** for demonstration purposes only.  
This allows flexible scenario creation for demo videos and user testing.  
All **MetaPay (ü™ô)** transactions ‚Äî including distributions and recollections ‚Äî are processed via **on-chain smart contracts**.

> üìù The frontend cash logic does not affect blockchain behavior or smart contract operations.

### üîó Live Demo (Metis Hyperion Deployment for NLnet Review)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important for NLnet Reviewers:**  
Although this repository contains the **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet** version (submitted before the August 1 deadline),  
we have also deployed an **identical functional version** on **Metis Hyperion Testnet** for smoother and faster interaction.  

We strongly recommend that NLnet reviewers **use the Hyperion version** for testing:  

- **Contract Address (Metis Hyperion):** `0xAaA0548C20677e24c1c9D68b1b8fA916666Bd40C`  
- **DApp Link:** [https://metapayp2p-hyperion-clean2.vercel.app/](https://metapayp2p-hyperion-clean2.vercel.app/)  

> **Note:** This Hyperion version is functionally identical to the Sepolia version but benefits from lower gas fees, faster transactions, and better UX.  
> Please use the **Hyperion deployment** for live interaction during your review process.
